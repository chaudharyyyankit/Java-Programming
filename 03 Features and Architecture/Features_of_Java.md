# Features of Java

## 1. Simple and Easy to Learn
- Clean syntax similar to C++
- Eliminates complex features like pointers
- Object-oriented programming paradigm

## 2. Object-Oriented
- Everything is an object
- Supports classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
- Promotes modular and reusable code

## 3. Platform Independent
- Write once, run anywhere (WORA)
- Bytecode compiled on JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
- Works on Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.

## 4. Secure
- Built-in security features
- Bytecode verification before execution
- No pointer manipulation
- Secure class loader and bytecode verifier

## 5. Robust
- Strong memory management
- Exception handling
- Automatic garbage collection
- Type checking at compile time

## 6. Multithreading
- Native support for concurrent programming
- Built-in threading capabilities
- Thread synchronization mechanisms

## 7. High Performance
- Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
- Optimized bytecode execution
- Efficient memory management

## 8. Distributed
- Network-oriented architecture
- Easy to build distributed applications
- RMI and socket programming support

## 9. Dynamic
- Runtime loading of classes
- Reflection capabilities
- Dynamic method invocation
